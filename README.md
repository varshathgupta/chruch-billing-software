# Expense Care

A web application to take care of oneâ€™s expenses by keeping an eye on them in a simple way. The app solves a very real problem of keeping an account of your regular every day expenses and making it available to view in various formats, so that one can easily analyse their spendings.

The application has been built by keeping in mind, that accounting our everyday expenses will only be possible for most people, if adding an expense is a very quick and easy process. Hence the app requires minimum details when one adds any expense although optional description is always possible if required.

The application majorly requires the user to create categories and add expenses to them. Rest all will be taken care of. The application allows user to view the data in a table with various filters, so that user can look at the expenses of any period whenever he/she wants. The applications provide bar graph and pie chart visualisation to allow user to view the data in a more visual format, so one can quickly see and get an idea of their expenses at any point of time.

Lastly every aspect of the application has been consciously kept simple and intuitive whether it is signing up, logging in, adding data, editing data, visualising data etc. so, that it can be used on a regular basis by anyone in general.
